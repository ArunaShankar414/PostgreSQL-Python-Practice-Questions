# PostgreSQL-Python-Practice-Questions
Jupyter Notebook containing 35+ questions for practicing your PostgreSQL skills in Python. Also contains a notebook with all the answers for your reference. The questions involve basic select, advanced select, aggregations and basic joins.

The questions in the Notebook closely follow the Hackerrank SQL questions progression, but the database and servers here are different.  As of now, Hackerrank only allows programming in Microsoft SQL, MySQL, Oracle, or DB2 databases but not in PostgreSQL.
